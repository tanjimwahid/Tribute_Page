            <h2>Here's a time line of Nikola's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1861</strong> - Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German,
                    arithmetic, and religion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1862</strong> - Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, where Tesla's father worked as
                    parish priest. Nikola completed primary school,
                    followed by middle school
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1873</strong> - He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a
                    telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.
                    Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he
                    worked as a draftsman
                    in the Central Telegraph Office instead.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1884</strong> - Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris
                    installation, was brought back to the United States
                    to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked
                    that Tesla be brought
                    to the United States as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1885</strong> - Tesla said "Good by to the Edison Machine Works"
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1886</strong> - They decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive
                    and opted to simply run an electric
                    utility.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1889</strong> - Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for
                    the next dozen years working out of a
                    series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1890</strong> - Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in
                    trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in
                    London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to
                    Westinghouse Electric.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1891</strong> - Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year,
                    he patented his Tesla coil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1895</strong> - Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab,
                    agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company,
                    set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as
                    new ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1901</strong> - he obtained $150,000 ($4,666,200 in today's dollars from J. P. Morgan in
                    return for a 51%
                    share of any generated
                    wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New
                    York, 100 miles
                    (161
                    km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.

                <li>
                    <strong>1906</strong> - Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects
                    trying to develop the transmission of
                    electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power
                    that he had been
                    demonstrating in wireless lighting.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1915</strong> - Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless
                    tuning patents. Marconi's initial radio
                    patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to
                    radio transmission
                    had been rejected several times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1917</strong> - Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via
                    using the reflection of an "electric ray" of
                    "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been
                    noted to have a
                    superficial resemblance to modern radar)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1943</strong> - Dies at the age of 86.

                <h2>6 Brilliant Tesla Inventions That Never Got Built</h2>

                <h3>
                    1. Earthquake Machine
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In 1893, Tesla patented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator that would vibrate up and down at
                    high speeds to generate
                    electricity. Years after patenting his invention he told reporters that one day while attempting
                    to tune his mechanical
                    oscillator to the vibration of the building housing his New York City laboratory, he caused the
                    ground to shake.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    2. Thought Camera
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla believed it could be possible to photograph thoughts. The inspiration came while he was
                    doing experiments in 1893,
                    Tesla told a newspaper reporter decades later: “I became convinced that a definite image formed
                    in thought must, by
                    reflex action, produce a corresponding image on the retina, which might possibly be read by
                    suitable apparatus.”
                </p>

                <h3>
                    3. Wireless Energy
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In 1901, Tesla secured $150,000 from financier J.P. Morgan to build a 185-foot-tall,
                    mushroom-shaped tower on the north
                    shore of Long Island capable of transmitting messages, telephony and images to ships at sea and
                    across the Atlantic
                    Ocean by using the Earth to conduct signals. As work began on the structure, called Wardenclyffe
                    Tower.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    4. Artificial Tidal Wave
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The engineer and physicist believed the power of science could be harnessed to prevent war. In
                    1907 the New York World
                    reported on another of Tesla’s military innovations in which wireless telegraphy would trigger
                    the detonations of high
                    explosives at sea to generate tidal waves so vast that they would capsize entire enemy fleets.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    5. Electric-Powered Supersonic Airship
                </h3>
                <p>
                    From the time Tesla was a boy, he had been fascinated with the idea of flight. Combining his
                    knowledge of electrical and
                    mechanical engineering, he began to think more about aviation after the failure of Wardenclyffe.
                    In an article in the
                    July 1919 issue of Reconstruction magazine, Tesla discussed his work on developing a supersonic
                    aircraft that would
                    travel eight miles above the surface of the Earth and generate speeds allowing passengers to
                    travel between New York
                    City and London in three hours.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    6. Death Beam
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla’s creative mind continued to spark new visions even late in his life. On his 78th
                    birthday, he told The New York
                    Times that he had come up with this most important invention, one that would “cause armies of
                    millions to drop dead in
                    their tracks.” The invention? A military weapon that would accelerate mercury particles at 48
                    times the speed of sound
                    inside a vacuum chamber and shoot a high-velocity beam.
